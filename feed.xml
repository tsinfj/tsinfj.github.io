In fact, the day I arrived in Canada marked our 900th day together. And now, our anniversary letter has grown from three digits to four. Looking back from day 900 to 1000, our story not only includes the symbolic milestone of 999 days, but also a shared reflection on the most fundamental question. That’s why I call these 100 days a period of “transformation.”</p> <p>The sweetest moment of all has to be the night of our 999th day. Truly, the Chinese language is profound — it can give a simple real number such beautiful and sweet meaning. The character “九” (nine), symbolizing “longevity,” represents the lasting love we both strive for. Honestly, when I think of how we journeyed together from that very first tender night, through 999 days from China to North America, only one word comes to mind: “legendary.” Yes, at this moment, let’s celebrate this love of ours — we are our own legend. The sweetness we’ve experienced is now captured on your warm photo wall; the hardships we’ve faced have become catalysts deepening our bond. My dear, please accept my congratulations — we’ve made it through 999 lasting days; and please accept my gratitude — thank you for standing by me through every disagreement and challenge. That night, as I posted on social media, how I wished we could have stood side by side, facing the sea, beneath the stars, listening to the waves — because sometimes, love is best expressed in silence.</p> <p>And then came the reflection on that most fundamental question: “Do I really like you?” Honestly, my first reaction was pain and shock. I couldn’t imagine why, after being together so long, such a question would arise. But as I calmed down, I realized this was a question worth contemplating together. Philosophically speaking, it’s the dialectic of “negation of the negation.” That night, when you asked me, I was truly afraid — afraid you wouldn’t find your answer. Thankfully, in the end, we reached the same conclusion: we admire each other, we’re drawn to each other, we like each other. Thank you, my love — it was a brave question, one that risked a painful answer, but transformation often comes through pain. After several days of emotional turmoil, we both found our answers.</p> <p>Yes, in that moment, we both underwent a transformation. I fully agree with what you said: marriage isn’t about age, but about timing. When the time is right, we’ll make our vows and complete that solemn chapter of life. Planning the future with you is one of the happiest things for me. Someday, we’ll curl up together, reading the same book, watching the same movie. Let me add — that book will be about our story, and that movie will capture our memories.</p> <p>You and I — together in the bustling Times Square of New York, walking quietly by Lake Ontario in Kingston, reminiscing our youth in Wudaokou, Beijing, and finding comfort in our own little haven. Thank you, my love, for these 1000 days of sweetness, bitterness, joy, and sorrow — they’ve all become part of how much I miss you. Please promise me we’ll continue to fight for our future. I believe that when the time is right, I will make that solemn promise — for us, for the future, for love.</p> <p>Happy 1000 days.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bo Wu</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[To my dearest Xiao Li(小璃),]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I love you.

Also grabbed some green rice cakes and water chestnut jelly from Aunt Xu. Sugarcane juice with lemon slices was incredibly refreshing — felt like I could drink one at every stand we passed. We visited Hongshan Zoo during off-peak hours — totally worth the ticket price. We saw black bears playing around and all sorts of clever primates. The constant uphill and downhill walks were exhausting. When we got to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, it was already closed, so we spontaneously decided to walk halfway around Xuanwu Lake instead. The breeze was nice — it would have been perfect if we weren’t bundled up in heavy winter pants. We originally planned to eat at Nanjing Impressions, but there were over 200 tables ahead of us, so we switched to a Hangzhou restaurant — also very good.

The roast duck from a roadside stall was also delicious — the chef’s cutting board was worn into a dent. Ming Xiaoling wasn’t very interesting, but the free photo before climbing the city wall was a nice touch. Meihua Mountain was beautiful, and it was the first time I saw plum blossoms in my life. After coming down, we spontaneously went to Nanjing Impressions — the Royal Pickled Pepper Chicken was tasty, but the rest of the dishes were similar to the disappointing experience we had in Shanghai. Two Sundae cones wrapped up our trip to Nanjing.</p> <p>Sometimes, street food stalls rival the internet-famous spots. Small local eateries with a touch of everyday life are well worth visiting — experiencing where locals dine is a special kind of joy.</p> <p>The whole trip was all about spontaneity — apart from the advance reservation for the Nanjing Museum, everything else was decided on the fly, including canceling the plan to visit Yangzhou. We originally wanted to visit *同里/甪直* upon returning to Suzhou but were too exhausted, so we postponed our return train. Back in Suzhou, we had an offline Papa John’s meal and then spontaneously took a stroll around Jinji Lake.</p> <p>Time to buckle down and study.
