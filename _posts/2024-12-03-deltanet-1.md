<p>On the night of April 7th, Xiao Li rushed to the train station right after class and boarded a train to Beijing.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 8th, I finally saw the one I had been longing for day and night at Beijing South Railway Station. I couldn’t stop smiling with happiness.</p>
<p>We took the subway to Tsinghua. Thanks to Xiangming’s treat, we enjoyed suancai fish and Hei Wuzhen — “clever rice” truly lives up to its name. We strolled briefly around the northern part of Tsinghua, took photos at Tsinghua Garden and Lover’s Slope, and wondered why there was only one mandarin duck left in the lotus pond at Jin Chun Garden. We paid our respects at the Foreign Languages Department — Xiao Li’s thesis will surely pass with flying colors.</p>
<p>After leaving Tsinghua, we rushed to catch the suburban train but missed it again — I seem to have a terrible sense of time. We changed the ticket to depart from Beijing Station instead. Thankfully, we still arrived at UCAS at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Xiao Li met people she had only seen in videos before, visited a canteen she’d only seen in videos, and even bought something from Manmanjia — a place she’d only ever bought things from for me.</p>
<p>April 10th  
We got up at 4:30 a.m., walked two kilometers in the dark to school, and discovered that the lights on the clock tower and the Great Wall do turn off. We went up to the observation deck with students from the astronomy institute — I was really worried we wouldn’t see the sunrise because of the clouds. But the sun did not disappoint; it pierced through the clouds — absolutely stunning, and well worth waking up early for.</p>
<p>We initially planned to visit the library after the observation deck, but that damned library doesn’t open until 8 a.m. — no wonder I don’t like going there. We had breakfast at the canteen — surprisingly good — and Xiao Li even got to enjoy the long-missed *lu beizi* (grilled food).</p>
<p>Around 8 a.m., we reached the main gate, boarded a coach heading into the city, and arrived at Tiananmen Square. There were many tour groups, and we grabbed a few people to take pictures for us.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m., we entered the Palace Museum. Compared to Nanjing Museum, I found the audio guides pretty interesting, though the Palace Museum’s “smart” guide wasn’t that smart — a bit clunky, honestly.</p>
<p>The first part of the Palace felt a bit dull — nothing to see inside the halls, no “glorious splendor” to speak of. But when we reached the East and West Six Palaces, it was Xiao Li’s domain. Years of watching *Empresses in the Palace* weren’t for nothing — she knew everything by heart.</p>
<p>We even tried afternoon tea at the Palace Museum. One of us clearly has taste bud issues — she found it sickly sweet, I found it flavorless. The lychee and bayberry were tasty, though — officially called... *Fragrant Red Plum Imperial Consort Drink*. I asked Xiao Li if we’d try afternoon tea again — her review: “Not even a dog would eat it.” After that, we continued our palace trek. At every palace, Xiao Li could recite lines from the drama — impressive, truly.</p>
<p>We thought we’d finish the Palace Museum tour by 2 p.m., but ended up staying until 4 p.m., leaving no time to visit Beijing Normal University, which was a shame since Professor Zhu helped us make the campus visit reservation yesterday.</p>
<p>Leaving the Palace, my legs and brain no longer felt like my own — I’d never been this exhausted. We planned to have a sightseeing bus drop us directly at the subway, but we were left 700 meters away — unbelievable. After a mix of subway and taxi rides, we arrived at the Mathematics Institute where I’ll be spending the next four years. After seeing Tsinghua, Xiao Li thought *Huli* was pitiful, but after seeing the Institute, she thought *Huli* was... not bad after all.</p>
<p>We picked a random home-style restaurant for dinner, but since it was nearly time for Xiao Li to leave — and given my poor track record with time — she decided to pack the food right after ordering and headed straight to the train station. Turns out, the only time I estimated correctly was the walking time — we arrived just as the gate was about to close. I thought we’d see each other again soon in Hainan at the end of June, but still couldn’t hold back at the ticket gate.</p>
<p>In two days, we slept less than 9 hours, walked 60,000 steps — a military-style tour for sure — but every place we explored and everything we did was pure joy.</p>
<p>Rest well. Study hard. Miss Xiao Li dearly.</p>
