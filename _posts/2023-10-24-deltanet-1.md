<p>We met in middle school, fell in love in university — our story is a long one, and every chapter is worth telling.</p>  
<p>These past two years have been a winding path in our lives, but we supported each other, helped each other along, and made it to where we are now.</p>  
<p>Thinking back to our last anniversary — we were still video-calling, eating Qiaojiao beef hotpot together through a screen, and it still felt so special. I tried hard to recall what we did for our first anniversary, but couldn’t remember — checked Photos and realized we were probably in lockdown then.</p>  
<p>This past year marked the beginning of our travel journey: Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, Beijing, Yangzhou, Sanya, Haikou, and soon, Changsha. Our travel style has evolved — from chasing hot spots to wandering through local alleys. The restaurants loved by locals are no less than the famous ones. We’ve started enjoying museums too, with audio guides — exploring the history of each region is truly fascinating.</p>  
<p>I think of the lockdown in Shanghai — we cooked together, lived together, sharing both joy and frustration. In Suzhou, we witnessed the end of the lockdown, got infected, but pulled through, and spontaneously went on a perfect Disney trip. Even tough times are filled with warmth and passion when I’m with Xiao Li(小璃).</p>  
<p>Our trip to Hainan was absolutely beautiful — unforgettable moments every single day. The Nanhai Guanyin statue, the crystal-clear waters and diving at Wuzhizhou Island, the spur-of-the-moment trip to Qionghai, and the bustling night markets of Haikou. The sky always seemed to meet the sea — I felt like I could eat another bowl of Qingbuliang, and each place had its own unique take on fried snacks. Watching two nights of concerts with Xiao Li was like writing a perfect chapter in the story of my youth — a memory I’ll cherish for life.</p>  
<p>The road of long-distance is a long one, but we won’t give up easily. We’ve had arguments, but far more sweet moments — we’re destined to be each other’s one and only. I love you. Happy 2nd anniversary 💖.</p>
