I like things that are fast in general: 
- Real analysis, complex analysis
- Sports: running, cycling, swimming(I used to be a competitive swimmer), skiing(beginner), and probably more
- Karting(beginner) and Formula One: I'm a fan of Guanyu Zhou, a Chinese racing driver who previously competed for Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber, and Max Verstappen
- Starship and other rockets
- High performance computing

Meanwhile, I am also interested in some card games, such as Hearthstone, riichi mahjong and Texas hold 'em poker: maintain a balanced strategy to protect your equity, and maximize your profit by exploiting opponents' imbalances.

Here's a glance at some of the other things I've been involving in outside of my primary academic focus:

## Sports

Outside of the academic world, I have a passion for triathlons. They provide a great way to stay fit and challenge myself physically and mentally. Here are some of my personal bests:
- Triathlon: None
- Swimming:  
  - 50m breaststroke: 37"44 (&#129351;<span style="color:gold">*1st place*</span> of group B[^1] at the Beijing International Studies University(BISU) Swimming Competition, 2021)
  - 100m breaststroke: 1'32"04 (<span style="color:black">*5th place*</span> of group B at the BISU Swimming Competition, 2023)
  - 50m freestyle: 31"40 (<span style="color:black">*4th place*</span> of group B at the BISU Swimming Competition, 2021)
  - 200m individual medley: 3'37"03 (&#129352;<span style="color:silver">*2nd place*</span> of group B at the BISU Swimming Competition, 2022)
- Cycling: None
- Running:
  - 1km: 3:23
  - 5km: 19:37
  - Half marathon: 1:53:48

[^1]: Departments and schools are divided into two groups based on the numbers of students of them. School of Economics has a few students, so it is in group B.

Besides, I'm also a beginner in skiing and diving (I mean, jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard).

## Food

I don't like:
- Spicy foods
- Sparkling water / soda
- Alcoholic drinks
- Coffee
- Tea

## Music

I can play the piano and the drums a bit. Although I’m not a professional, I enjoy practicing in my free time, especially when I want to relax or express my emotions through music. I also like to listen to symphonies—they help me unwind and appreciate the beauty of classical music. The rich layers of sound and the emotion behind each piece always inspire me. Music plays an important role in my life, both as a hobby and as a source of comfort.

## Movies

My favorite movies are Tenet and The Matrix. I really enjoy films that explore complex ideas like time, reality, and human perception. Both movies have mind-bending plots, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes that make me want to watch them over and over again. I love how they challenge the way we think about the world and push the boundaries of science fiction.
