<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I'm Bo Wu, a finance student at Beijing International Studies University, advised by [Prof. Jia Zhai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jia-Zhai-4). I have a strong academic background in mathematics and finance, with experience in market research and auditing from internships at CITIC Securities and Grant Thornton. I've also conducted research using tools like Stata, R, and Python, focusing on economic impacts and policy evaluations. Passionate about quantitative finance, I am preparing for graduate studies to further explore this field.

Her research is centered on the intersection of **machine learning systems** and **large language models**, with a specific focus on hardware-aware algorithm design for efficient sequence modeling.

She believes in open-sourcing and 🐳. Check out the open source library [flash-linear-attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention) and the [ASAP seminar](https://asap-seminar.github.io/). To learn about her research, check out [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0HJvGSWw8A) and the [slides](https://github.com/sustcsonglin/linear-attention-and-beyond-slides/blob/main/main.pdf). The best way to find her is through [FLA Discord](https://discord.gg/vDaJTmKNcS).
